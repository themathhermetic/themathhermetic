- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning real analysis (fucking Riemann integrals), vector and tensor calculus.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in pure mathematics, specially linear algebra, ring/group theory, non-associative algebras and number theory.
- :neckbeard: I try to code from time to time (C/Java), but I tend to give up pretty fast.

I have no clue on how to use this, but @Falme asked me to create an account so, yeah, here I am I guess.
